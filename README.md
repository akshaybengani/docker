# Docker

Docker is a system which provide us functionality to divide our services and software in containerized system. 

### Deploy a Nginx Server

```docker
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx
```
*   Whenever we need to use conatiners either for creating or deleting or modifying we use the argument ```container```
*   To run a container we need ```run``` command.
*   To Publish a container like on a port or server we use the ```--publish``` command with port numbers assigned.
*   The 1st port number is the current system PORT which provide that service. And the 2nd one is the Container port it can be anyone for now but if there is one service I prefer using same port.
*   Since when we run a server it accepts and sends requests in a for loop and wait for the network for an activity, as such these containers dont stop automatically as such we neee to use   ```--detach``` flag to continue running container in background.
*   Now its time to specify the container image name and thats it ```nginx```.

### To List all the Containers
```docker
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
c7fb1939cc25        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   11 seconds ago      Up 10 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   condescending_robinson
```
* To get information of all running containers we use the parameter ```ps```.
* To get info of all running and not running containers we have to add the flag ```-a``` in the command to list all the containers.
* The container id is always created for us and the name is also required as unique.
* If we dont specify the name it picks a name from an open source list of names.
* The names are of the popular hackers, scientists, researchers and lot more and its interesting sometimes.
### To Stop a Running Container
```docker
docker conatiner stop 69049265872
```
*   In order to stop a container we need to use the ```stop``` keyword.
*   Next to it is the container ID.
### To Add a custom name to the Container
```docker
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx
```
* To add your own name in a container use the ```--name``` flag and pass the single word unique name for the container.
### To get logs of a container
```docker
docker conatiner logs webhost
```
* To get logs of a background running container use the keyword ```logs``` after conatiner and then specify the conatiner name at the end.
### To get the list of running services in the container
```docker
docker conatiner top webhost
```
*   This is a direct command to list the number of processes running inside the container for now.
### To Delete a  Container
```docker
docker rm CONTAINER_ID
```
* To Delete a container or image we use the ```rm``` command and pass the container id or name
### To Delete forcefully
```docker
docker rm -f CONTAINER_ID 
```
* Just add the ```-f``` flag this will stop and then delete the conatiner.
